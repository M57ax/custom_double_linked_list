# Doubly Linked List in C++

This project includes a custom implementation of a doubly linked list in C++.
A doubly linked list is a dynamic data structure where each node stores a value and two pointers: one to the previous node and one to the next.

## With this structure you can:

Insert and remove elements efficiently at both ends ~~and in the middle~~ of the list.

~~Traverse the list forward and backward.~~

Manage memory manually for learning purposes, without relying on std::list.

## How to start

- cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
- cd build
- ninja
- ./main
